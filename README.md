# Programming Basics Course

The "Programming Basics" course provides foundational programming skills necessary for all technological specialties at the Software University. This includes writing program code at an introductory level (basic coding skills), working with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), utilizing variables and data, operators and expressions, console manipulation (reading input data and printing results), using conditional statements (if, if-else), and loops (for, while, do-while).

## Course Content

The course covers the following topics:

- Console input and output data manipulation
- Working with loops (for)
- Handling more complex logical checks
- Working with conditional statements (if-else)
- Performing simple computations
- Working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while loops)

Throughout this course, learners will acquire essential skills in handling console input and output, mastering basic and more complex loops, conditional statements, and performing computations using programming logic.
